1. Add arithmetic operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to make the following expressions true. You can use any parentheses youâ€™d like.

    (3+1)/3*9 = 12

2. Write a function/method utilizing Java, Javascript, Objective-C or Swift to determine whether two strings are anagrams or not
   (examples of anagrams: debit card/bad credit, punishments/nine thumps, etc.)

   Please look at file name AnagramString.js

3. Write a method in Java, Javascript, Objective-C or Swift to generate the nth Fibonacci number
   (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34....)
   A. recursive approach
   B. iterative approach

   Please look at NthFibonacci.js

4. Which architecture would you use for the required task below? Why?

    I would use component based architecture. Component based architecture would allow us to re-use the existing components
    throughout whole project. It also allows easy extension of the existing component to improve or add features to the mobile app.

5. Create a currency converter by utilizing data from the fixer.io API.
